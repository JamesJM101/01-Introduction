This is a project for my game technology class.
The program gives the different questions that can be asked and then prompts you to enter a number from the list.
If you enter a number from 1-6 the program answers the relevant question and prompts another input.If you enter something other than one of these numbers, the program tells you "Please select an option from the list"
Entering 7 will cause the program to print "Goodbye" and exits the input loop.
